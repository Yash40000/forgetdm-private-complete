# Enterprise Self-Service Capability Matrix

This matrix is an implementation and evidence checklist, not a marketing claim. Vendor behavior was checked against the official K2View and GenRocket material linked below.

| Capability | ForgeTDM status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Governed product catalog | Implemented | Unified DataScope, Synthetic, Mapping, Reservation, and virtual-data products in `/api/self-service/v2/catalog`. |
| Safe request questionnaire | Implemented | Product-owned questionnaire, environment allowlist, purpose, test type, volume, variety, delivery, schedule, and reservation inputs. |
| Maker-checker approval | Implemented | Requester cannot approve their own request; approve/reject decisions are immutable events. |
| Guardrails | Implemented | Maximum volume, reservation duration, environment, enabled state, and artifact approval checks run server-side. |
| Fulfillment | Implemented | Launches the real DataScope, Synthetic, Mapping, Reservation, Provision/Refresh/Rollback engines. |
| Request lifecycle | Implemented | Draft-free request, approval queue, scheduled/ready/running/completed/failed/cancelled status and comment timeline. |
| API and runner support | Implemented | REST endpoints and token-safe shell launch/status commands. |
| Versioned products | Implemented | Published artifacts retain product settings and source artifact/version references. |
| Reservation/refresh/rollback | Implemented | Governed reservation and virtual data lifecycle product types. |
| Notifications and audit | Implemented | Order events, comments, audit events, and existing platform webhook integration. |
| Test Domain | Implemented foundation | Pins a discovered topology version/hash, exposes human-readable relationships, and binds governed artifacts plus an approved execution product. Rich Business Entity/privacy certification remains next. |
| Scenario Blueprint | Implemented | Typed preconditions, event, outcomes, coverage, questionnaire, delivery and verification contracts with immutable version snapshots. |
| Intent-to-data compiler | Implemented deterministic slice | Compiles a selected Blueprint and structured tester Mission into the existing Self-Service engines. Private free-text grounding through Forge Data Store remains planned. |
| Coverage Composer | Implemented core | Baseline, boundary, negative, state-transition, and bounded pairwise cases with de-duplication and explicit warnings. Equivalence, decision tables, and exclusion constraints remain planned. |
| Ready-to-Test Pack | Implemented technical foundation | Retains scenario handles, expected outcomes, engine/reject/topology/coverage verification, lineage, reservation, and reset capability. Physical entity handles and fixture downloads remain planned. |
| Shared-schema SaaS tenant isolation | Not claimed | Current supported model remains deployment-per-client. Certification requires isolation and penetration evidence. |
| Vendor-certified connector breadth | Not claimed | Optional JDBC connectivity is tracked separately from certified, load-tested connector support. |

The target-state product design and implementation sequence are defined in
`docs/enterprise/FORGETDM_SCENARIO_FABRIC_BLUEPRINT.md`.
