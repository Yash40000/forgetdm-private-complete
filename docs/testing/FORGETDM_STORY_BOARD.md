# ForgeTDM Product Readiness Story Board

ForgeTDM product validation is managed as a continuous queue, not by sprint or release-cycle milestones.

## Board Views

## Queue Policy

1. Keep no more than ten stories in `status:ready`.
2. Treat `status:ready` as queue eligibility only. Execution starts only after `STORY_EXECUTION_APPROVALS.json` records the approver and allowed scope and `assert-story-approved.ps1` passes.
3. Move an approved selected story from `status:ready` to `status:in-progress` when execution starts.
4. Move a failed story to `status:blocked` and link the defect, sanitized evidence, and affected build.
5. Move a passing story to `status:done` only after regression and evidence review, then close it.
6. Promote the next highest-risk dependency-ready story from `status:backlog` to `status:ready` so the Ready queue returns to ten.
7. Never use a sprint date to imply release readiness. Readiness comes from passed gates and reviewed evidence.

## Deferred Campaigns

- `LEGAL-001` and `LEGAL-002` are deferred to a separate legal and diligence campaign as of
  2026-07-20. Keep them out of engineering execution and do not count them as passed, failed, or
  HARD-PASS until qualified legal reviewers provide retained evidence.

The GitHub credential currently has repository access but not GitHub Projects permission. These filtered Issues views therefore serve as the working board without weakening repository privacy or requiring a paid test-management product.
