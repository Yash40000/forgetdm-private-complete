# Defect Register

Defects found while executing the ForgeTDM test stories. Each defect is a tracked record here and should be mirrored to a GitHub issue labeled `type:defect` and linked to the story that surfaced it.

## Rules

- A defect is raised for every reproducible deviation from a story's acceptance criteria.
- If the defect is fixed in the same pass, record the fix (file + commit) and set **Status: CLOSED** with a verification note.
- If not fixed, leave **Status: OPEN**, set severity, and link it from the story so the story moves to `status:blocked` when the failing case is required.
- Never record credentials, tokens, cookie values, clear PII, or secrets.

## Severity

`BLOCKER` (release-blocking) · `HIGH` · `MEDIUM` · `LOW`
