# Ready Test Pack

This directory contains the executable specifications for the ten stories currently in `status:ready` on the ForgeTDM product-readiness board.

## Execution Rules

- `status:ready` is queue eligibility, not execution approval. Before running a story, record its authorized scope in `STORY_EXECUTION_APPROVALS.json` and pass `assert-story-approved.ps1`; retain the generated entry-gate evidence with the story evidence.
- The product owner delegated execution approval to the Codex test coordinator on 2026-07-19. The coordinator may approve a story to start after its entry criteria pass, but may not use that approval as final acceptance; a separate evidence review remains mandatory.
- Approval for local test fixtures never authorizes production, customer data, paid services, external notifications, or an unscoped destructive action. Those scopes require a separate explicit approval.
- `NOT RUN` means the specification exists but no pass claim has been made.
- Record the immutable build commit, environment, database or driver versions, operator, timestamps, and issue number before execution.
- Attach sanitized responses, screenshots, audit event IDs, database assertions, and logs to the linked issue.
- Never attach credentials, connection secrets, customer data, clear PII, or authentication tokens.
- A failed required case blocks the story; link the defect and rerun the affected regression cases after the fix.
- Move a story to `status:done` only after every required case passes, retained evidence exists, and an independent review agrees.
- A resource-dependent case may be marked `HARD-PASS` only when the missing fixture is explicit. HARD-PASS is not a functional pass or vendor certification.

`CODE-VERIFIED` is not verified. A correct-looking implementation can still fail in transaction, browser, driver, or vendor behavior. Only direct retained execution evidence supports a pass claim.

The source catalog is [FORGETDM_TEST_CASE_CATALOG.csv](../../FORGETDM_TEST_CASE_CATALOG.csv), and the execution policy is [FORGETDM_MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md](../../FORGETDM_MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md).
